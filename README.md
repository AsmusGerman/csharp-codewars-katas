## Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a community of developers (Code Warriors) who train to improve their coding skills by completing code the challanges made by its own comunity.

In order to understand their culture there are some concepts like Kata, Kyu/Dan and Ranks you should understand to get into the Codewars idea before you enter the dojo.

In this way, a Kata references a particular code challange to be solved by some programming language. Each Kata has a difficulty level or Kyu (Dan for higher levels), and has a meaning of progress for the Code Warriors, starting with 8-Kyu (lowest) through 1-Kyu, and 1-Dan to 8-Kyu.

## Structure

```
